# Python for Data Science Project

## General Information

This mini-course is intended for you to demonstrate foundational Python skills for working with data. The completion of this course involves working on a hands-on project where you will develop a simple dashboard using Python.

This course is part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/ibm-data-science) and the [IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/ibm-data-analyst).

PRE-REQUISITE: [Python Basics for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/python-basics-for-data-science) course from IBM is a pre-requisite for this project course. Please ensure that before taking this course you have either completed the Python Basics for Data Science course from IBM or have equivalent proficiency in working with Python and data.

NOTE: This course is not intended to teach you Python and does not have too much instructional content. It is intended for you to apply prior Python knowledge.

## Learning objectives

In this course you will learn about:

* Demonstrate your skills for working with Python and Data
* Create a dashboard that shows key performance indicators from a specific data set

## Course Introduction

Welcome to this Python Project!

This mini-course is intended to be a follow-on to the [Python for Data Science, AI and Development course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai) for you to demonstrate basic Python skills that you have acquired in that course.

In this mini-course you will be assuming the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst. In this role you will be given a scenario and data to begin your Python project. During this process you will perform specific tasks such as extracting data, web scraping, visualizing data, and creating a dashboard. You will then submit your Python notebook and screenshots for your peers to review and evaluate your work.

To be successful in completing this project, you should have already completed the [Python for Data Science, AI and Development course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai) or have equivalent skills for working with Data and Python.
